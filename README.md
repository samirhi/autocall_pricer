# Finance project - Pricer for Autocall products
## Context
This is a toy project in Python that I wrote using stochastic calculus and finance fundamentals. It computes the fair price of autocalls, a range of financial exotic structured products. (See <i><u>Exotic Options and Hybrids: A Guide to Structuring, Pricing and Trading</u>, M. Bouzoubaa, A. Osseiran</i>)
As of now, the pricer uses a Black-Scholes stochastic model to price the autocalls.
